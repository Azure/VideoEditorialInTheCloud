# Abstract

This readme file explains the value of video editorial in the cloud using Avid Media Composer and Avid Nexis on Microsoft Azure and summarizes key resources in this repository: a deployment guide and deployment scripts. The deployment guide included in this repository explains, step-by-step, how to deploy these applications into your Azure subscription.  The deployment guide and accompanying scripts are designed for media production companies that want to provide an edit-on-demand deployment experience.

# Summary

The cloud will transform how creatives in the Media and Entertainment Industry produce content and collaborate across teams and geographies.  Despite the dramatic potential of the cloud to transform the industry, many creative individuals, teams and companies are not sure how or where to begin their cloud journey.  Microsoft and Avid Technologies have worked jointly on many cloud editorial projects and projects enabling major media companies to migrate their video production workflows to Azure.  We have found the most empowering approach is to learn by doing, ie. Just start experimenting, hands-on, with how Avid on Azure enables cloud-based content production.

The deployment guide and accompanying scripts in this repository enable that hands-on experimentation.  The deployment guide provides step-by-step guidance for installing and configuring a proof of concept environment for you and or your team to immediately deploy and use Avid’s industry leading products – Media Composer and Nexis – for content editing on the Azure Cloud.
